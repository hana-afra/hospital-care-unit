# Hospital Monitoring System - README

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a monitoring system for a hospital with various services such as cardiology, pneumology, gynecology, etc. Each service has its own intensive care unit (ICU) and a Critical State Unit (CSU) for patients in critical condition. The system will manage patient information, monitor vital signs, and allow medical staff to access current and historical patient data.

## Project Structure

### Part A: ADT for Monitoring System
1. **Graphical Representation of ADT**
   - Provide a visual diagram of the Abstract Data Type (ADT) for the monitoring system.
2. **Specification of ADT**
   - Define the ADT, including data types, operations, and their specifications.
3. **Implementation of Operations**
   - Implement the operations specified in the ADT using suitable data structures and algorithms.
4. **Program for Average Admission Time**
   - Develop a program to compute the average time taken to admit a new patient to the hospital.

### Part B: User Representation using Binary Search Tree (BST)
5. **Implementation of BST Operations**
   - Implement operations for managing users (patients, doctors, nurses) using a Binary Search Tree.
6. **Program for Average Admission Time**
   - Develop a program to compute the average time taken to admit a new patient using BST.

### Part C: User Representation using AVL Tree
7. **Implementation of AVL Tree Operations**
   - Implement operations for managing users using an AVL Tree.
8. **Program for Average Admission Time**
   - Develop a program to compute the average time taken to admit a new patient using AVL Tree.
9. **Comparison and Conclusion**
   - Compare the average admission times obtained using the ADT, BST, and AVL Tree. Provide conclusions based on the comparison.
